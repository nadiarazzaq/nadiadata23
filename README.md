# Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?

I chose this question because I was interested in how flyers felt about having the person seated in front of them recline during a flight. I found this data set interesting because it reveals what plane etiquette looks like today and what people expect from fellow flyers.

This chart shows how respondents feel about people reclining their seat on a plane. It reveals that a large portion of respondents feel that it is "not rude at all" -- more so than those who believe it is "somewhat rude" or "very rude."
